Welcome to GamingOGs event map; this map is created explicitly for server admins and owners who love to host events. This event map is basically to replace the outdated event map that everyone uses. In our event map, you'll host just about any event/area you can think of and we have created this map to maximize FPS and performance boost for all players.

[h1]F.A.Q: [/h1]

[h2]Is this map optimized? [/h2]
Yes, unlike some of the other event maps on the steam workshop we created this map to ensure it was fully optimized to give the highest amount of FPS client and server sided to ensure this runs as smooth as possible when hosting events with large audiences. We also have our arenas setup using a level-streaming system, which allows you to load the resources without putting much strain on your computer hardware.

[h2]Do you plan on adding new arenas? [/h2]
Yes! We are very interested in adding new arenas. We are very excited to work closely with the community of players/server owners/admins, and so forth to provide the best event map possible. If you have any suggestions or areas you would like us to create, please head over to the discussions page and leave me some suggestions!
